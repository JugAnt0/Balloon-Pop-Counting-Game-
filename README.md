# 🎈 Balloon Pop

A fun and simple **timing game** built in Python.  
Each turn, the balloon grows bigger — you must **decide when to pop it**.  
The larger the balloon when you pop it, the higher your score…  
But if you wait too long, it bursts and the game ends! 💥

## ✨ Features
- Random burst point every round (keeps it exciting).  
- Player decides: pump the balloon 🎈 or pop it 💥.  
- Score increases based on balloon size when popped.  
- Game ends when the balloon bursts.

## 🕹️ How to Play
1. Run the program in Python.  
2. On each turn:  
   - Press **Enter** to pump the balloon (it grows by 1–3 points).  
   - Type **`pop`** to pop it safely and earn points.  
3. If you pump too much and the balloon passes its hidden burst point → 💀 it bursts and the game ends!  
4. Try to score as high as possible before the balloon bursts.
